            "description": "When Paul Quinn College decided to convert its football field into an organic farm, eyebrows were raised.  But the move symbolized the College’s dedication to a team of a different kind – the team of individuals and organizations fighting to end food insecurity and injustice in the United States.  The We Over Me Farm has produced more than 40,000 pounds of organic produce since its inception in March 2010.  No less than 10% of this produce has been donated to neighborhood charitable organizations, through a partnership with the North Texas Food Bank.  The remainder is sold to community members, restaurants, and grocers throughout Dallas, to subsidize the farm's operational expenses. The highest profile customer is Legends Hospitality which services the Owners’ Suite at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.  In addition to providing fresh, healthy, affordable food options for its surrounding residents, the Farm strives to improve communities throughout the metroplex by providing hands-on educational experiences for youth and adults alike to promote healthy eating, improved food access, and environmental stewardship.  Come hear more about how the Farm is operated and maintained entirely by Paul Quinn student-employees, who actively engage in all farm activities, from business planning to marketing, and thus serves as a model of socially and environmentally-driven servant leadership and entrepreneurship.

            "description": "Paul Quinn College (Paul Quinn), GridMarket, EarthX and Environ Partners today announced a strategic plan to bring cost-effective energy procurement, valuable infrastructure upgrades, and renewable energy generation to the Paul Quinn campus. For the first phase, revised energy procurement and a 25-year solar power purchase agreement will enable the college to achieve energy and sustainability targets while driving increased revenue. The project was first conceptualized in 2018 when GridMarket conducted a comprehensive analysis of energy operations at the campus. GridMarket’s process includes the application of its data-driven artificial intelligence platform to remotely survey properties for distributed energy opportunities. The platform produces customized energy recommendations based on the unique priorities of a property or portfolio. For Paul Quinn, GridMarket provided the framework for an optimized energy strategy and, with local solar development firm, Go Big Solar, helped the college select vendors through its competitive marketplace to cost-effectively address energy and infrastructure needs.
